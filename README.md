Program files:
- Figure-1.py - Creates the figures for the manuscript, plotting the records over time for the total number and control species (Figure 1), Ceratina species (Figure 2), Lasioglossum species (Figure 3), and the often misidentified species (Figure 4). 
- BIML_Analyzer-clean.py - Automatically generates states of pre- and post-2000 records, and also calculates the number of estimated invalid records. Does this for the three datasets separately. 
- biml-compare.py - A short script that compares datasets to find the differences.



Data files:
- Mid-Atlantic bees dataset: We examine the dataset version that includes all specimens, regardless of trap type (“Mid-Atlantic USA wild bee occurrences, all records” https://springernature.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Mid-Atlantic_USA_wild_bee_occurrences_all_records/10266458?backTo=/collections/A_long-term_dataset_on_wild_bee_abundance_in_Mid-Atlantic_United_States/4728725)
- Anthropogenic bees dataset: We examined a subset of BIML data from the northeastern United States spanning 2001–2015 that was used to examine habitat preferences of native bees (Collado et al. 2019) dataset archived on Dryad:  https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8md5419
