Program files:
- Figure-1-2025-TOTALS.py - Creates the figures for the manuscript, plotting the records over time for the total number and control species (Figure 1), Ceratina species (Figure 2), Lasioglossum species (Figure 3), the often misidentified species (Figure 4), and the estimate invalid records (Figure 5). 
- BIML_Analyzer-clean-2025.py - Automatically generates states of pre- and post-2010 records, and also calculates the number of estimated invalid records. Does this for the three datasets separately. 
- biml-compare-2025.py - A short script that compares datasets to find the differences.
- BIML-data-venn-2025.py - a program to make a venn diagram of the overlap in the number of records between the 3 different datasets.
